# üè† House Tracking with Notion
I just moved into my first house in college, and **staying organized has been tough**. Shared costs get lost in group chats, chores become forgotten, and shopping list items are never seen again. Our house was fed up, and decided to build a solution of our own. Introducing `commates`. It's a suite of tools designed for any house that is based on your house's needs, and **seamlessly integrates within notion**.
